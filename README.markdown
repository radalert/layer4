# layer4

Layer4 is a collection of [transports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layer_4:_Transport_Layer)
for getting metrics and alert data in and out of Pacemaker.

Truth be told, it's just a way of not saving money by avoiding a cambrian
explosion of repositories.

Every subdirectory is a separate project.
